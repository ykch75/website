## Function

I need more time and knowledge to do them

## Challenge

for the first time for using
* html

* everything

## Impression

I use realtime database.  
I searched the way to edit data by using realtime database but i can't search.  
Then I thought that realtime database can't edit contents.  
I try chenging the kind of database.  
I really enjoyed html, css and JavaScript. I  want to study more!
I understand why we have to use .env and tried to make .env but It doesn't show up anymore when I use .env.
